# pyzim.github.io
Proposed pyzim community website

This site is created using [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable) and the [dopetrope](https://html5up.net/dopetrope) theme. To contribute you would like to first checkout pelican and how it works. 
Pages are generated from markdown and the hosting is done with [github pages](https://pages.github.com).
